Deepak formerly known as Deepak talkies was started in 1926 by Tokershi Jivraj Gandhi, a Kutchi landlord in Lower Parel. It started out as a venue for musicals and circus shows. In 1931 it got converted into a cinema with the arrival of talkies in Mumbai. People go to cinema for the sole reason of leisure. Leisure is the time when one is not working or occupied.

The majority of the current audience at the movie theatre now are the people who work in the offices around the cinema. They come to this place after their working hours. It even attracts a lot of film and art critics. This is the representational space. The other speciality of this place is the fact that they do not have an interval during the movie unlike multiplexes though the purpose of same is to economise the running expenses.This theatre also added its name to history when the owner Shobhana Shah became the cityâ€™s only woman cinema owner from 1998 to 2007. Movie theatre has transitioned from cinema hall showing B grade movies to up market theatre showcasing international classics. This shows the cinemas transition from mass culture to high brow culture. This transition also shows the spatial practice of the place.

I have been going to Deepak Talkies from the past few years. the experience of going to a single screen cinema is completely different from going to a multiplex. The ticket prices is one major difference but the atmosphere in both the places is also completely different. A few months ago, I had heard that the cinema had shut down and i was really upset as I had a lot of memories associated with this place. When I got an assignment for my sociology class on space, I instantly knew I have to work on this place. I had a really tough time gathering data on the place as it had shut down and I could not enter it. But the amount of research and hard work was worth it at the end of the day.


The one advice I can give you if you are trying to document a place is that make sure the place is open and there are people who go there so that it is easier for you to gather data. Unlike me who did not research beforehand about the place and realised that the place has shut down when she got there.
