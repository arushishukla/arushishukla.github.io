Deepak formerly known as Deepak talkies was started in 1926 by Tokershi Jivraj Gandhi, a Kutchi landlord in Lower Parel. It started out as a venue for musicals and circus shows. In 1931 it got converted into a cinema with the arrival of talkies in Mumbai. People go to cinema for the sole reason of leisure. Leisure is the time when one is not working or occupied.

Majority of the audience were the mill workers who used to come to this cinema after their working hours. The cinema started facing difficulties in the 1980’s with the popularity of colour television and video players. Up until the 1990’s Deepak talkies was showcasing A-list Hindi films. In the 1990’s with the uprising of multiplexes in the country, it faced difficulties in staying afloat and in order to retain its customers it started showcasing mass movies in regional languages like Telugu, Marathi, and Bhojpuri. With the ticket prices around 30-50 rupees it patronised the working class audience which included taxi drivers, vegetables vendors etc who used to huddle outside the cinema to check the prices of daily shows. Over a period of time the cinema majorly started attracting male dominated crowd who would often get unruly. The walls were stained with paan and the chairs had negligible cushioning and were infected with bugs. Hence it was not surprising when this single screen  movie theatre was staring at a lost battle against multiplexes. Many people prefer multiplexes over single screen cinema due to the tangible experiences that the multiplexes offer such as, ambience, security, comfort, snacking counters, cleanliness and ample parking which in turn impacts the decisions of the audience.

The owners had a deep sentimental value attached to the place as it had been passed down in the family for generations. With the changing of landscape around Lower Parel and with creeping of neo-capitalism in the area, the current cinema owners then realised that they needed a revamp in order to adapt to the changing times with their representation of space. A visitor told them that the architecture of the building gave feel of British ambience. Hence the owners decided to use the concept of fractured modernity and refurbished the cinema keeping the exterior of the building intact while making changes to the interior of the complex. They reduced their seating from 850 to 450 in order to create comfortable seating. The owners took a bold step by increasing their prices from 50 to 150 rupees which changed the demography of the people coming to this place. They wanted to attract wealthy residents from the upcoming apartment complexes such as Indiabulls Sky, The Park, World One. The owners of this cinema make sure to give an “owner’s welcome” to each visitor which gives people a sense of belongingness to the place and makes them feel like a part of a family. The owners did this in order to control the theatres quality and crowd. They took advantage of the open space that they have and converted it into a courtyard with tables and chairs where the audience can sit down before the movie starts and ends. The ambience that encourages lounging around is unlike regular multiplexes where the majority of the audience line up in the queue for food as soon as they enter in and then head straight to the hall, and leave as soon as the movie ends. The owners decided to retain two statues of elephants made of  stone over the years as it reminded them of their history from when the place started out as a circus. To boost their image they collaborated with Matterden Centre for Films and Creations, which focuses on showcasing international movies. They dedicated their 7pm slot to showcase world classic movies. The transition of the place from a circus to a talkie and then to a cinema is the spatial practice of the place. In 1981, the government passed a law which says that every property that holds a cinema is earmarked with the designation of a cinema and the owners have to run the cinema for life and it cannot be transformed.

The majority of the current audience at the movie theatre now are the people who work in the offices around the cinema. They come to this place after their working hours. It even attracts a lot of film and art critics. This is the representational space. The other speciality of this place is the fact that they do not have an interval during the movie unlike multiplexes though the purpose of same is to economise the running expenses.This theatre also added its name to history when the owner Shobhana Shah became the city’s only woman cinema owner from 1998 to 2007. Movie theatre has transitioned from cinema hall showing B grade movies to up market theatre showcasing international classics. This shows the cinemas transition from mass culture to high brow culture. This transition also shows the spatial practice of the place.
