Attending an open mic event was an amazing experience. the atmosphere of the place and the people were so different than I ever experienced. The event took place in Malabar hills in the evening. When I got there, people had already started performing their poetry. A few of them even played their own music. The one unique thing about an open mic event is the audience. The audience in this event instead of clapping, snapped their fingers whenever they felt that somebody had a good poetry. The audience were very encouraging and most of them were the people who performed. A lot of people who performed were very dramatic in their approach. It was fun even being a spectator in the event.
