Rupi Kaur is an instagram poet of Punjabi descent. Born in India and bought up in Canada, she rose to fame when her first book `Milk and Honey` which was published in 2014 became a New York Times Bestseller. She recently published her second book the `Sun and her Flowers` and is currently on a tour. She was on a three month tour of India where she performed her poetry in various cities. Her last performance occurred in Mumbai on 7th March.


Going for the event was an exciting experience. The room was filled with all types of people. It was not just women but there were a lot of men. There was just one spotlight which focused on her and the stage was plain but the area where she was standing was decorate with flowers in a perfect circle. The room fell dead silent when she entered wearing her shear silver gown. People snapped their fingers whenever they found something interesting and they clapped after her every reading. She performed four of her poems and whenever she did it felt like you were transcended into another world.
